# This is a simple adaptive dekstop landing page

[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-with-love.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

Got the landing page design from [DidiKurniawan](https://dribbble.com/shots/11356916-LaslesVPN) and slicing it into simple website made with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

## Getting Started

```
Setup environtment :

You need to install node js latest version or (10)
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install (run once after clone)

for run development mode

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Go Check It Out

I already deploy it in Heroku [LaslesVPN](https://laslessvpn.herokuapp.com/)
